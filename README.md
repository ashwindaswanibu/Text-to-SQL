This paper explores the application of advanced NLP techniques in translating natural language queries into SQL queries. We focus on inte- grating schema information with GPT models, applying retrieval augmentation using sentence transformers, and fine-tuning LLaMA 7B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). These methods aim to improve query accuracy and provide user-friendly database interactions.
